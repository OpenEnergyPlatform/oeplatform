  "general": "The aim of SzenarienDB is to create a publicly accessible database on which scenario data, i.e. all data related to a scenario calculation, are summarised and published. This includes both input and output data of the calculation. In addition, the data is linked to the model descriptions. ",
  "tasks": "The Open Energy Platform (OEP) has been reworked and redesigned. As a major output, the Open Energy Ontology (OEO) has been created and developed collaboratively. This is significantly improving transparency and the exchange of scenario data.",
