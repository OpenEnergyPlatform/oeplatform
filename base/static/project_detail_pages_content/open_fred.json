    "acronym": "open_FRED",
    "projectStatus": "isFinished",
    "general": "In open_FRED, the requirements, assumptions and possibilities of energy system analysis and climate models are examined in order to create high-quality, transparent and citable data sets. These are then linked to open source simulation models that generate feed-in time series of fluctuating renewable energies.",
    "tasks": "The aim of open_FRED is to create a data basis for energy system analyses with a uniform standard. For this purpose, the project participated in the development of the Open Energy platform with relevant data sets for power plant, climate and basic data.",
