	<li>Transparency of energy system modelling and fruitful debates about it are very much depending on a common understanding of expressions. Therefore we started a <a href="https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Category:Glossary" target="_blank">glossary</a>. You can watch up; debate and add expressions.</li>
	<li>At the <a href="https://forum.openmod-initiative.org/" target="_blank">discussion forum</a> of the openmod initiative you can discuss about various subjects concerning open science in energy system modelling.</li>
