<h3>Some introductory words</h3> <br>
On this part of our platform you find the OpenEnergy database (oedb) and the fact sheets. Both are already usable though still under
continuous improvement. They were developed following the requirement to improve / ameliorate_ the transparency of energy system models 
and their outputs as well as the reproducibility of their scenario results. The fact sheets aim to give an overview of the existing models 
to modelers and other stakeholders interested in energy system modelling. Moreover, together with the database they are meant to provide 
the base to discuss various scenarios.
