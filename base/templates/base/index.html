<h3>Welcome to the OpenEnergy Platform!</h3> <br>
<div style="line-height: 140%;">
This platform mainly addresses students, researchers and scientists in the field of energy modelling and 
analytics as well as interested persons in those fields. The platform provides great tools to make 
your energy system modelling process transparent!
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:5px">You can <strong>give, get and document data</strong> of your modelling process (figure) through to the <a href="http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/dataedit/" target="_blank">OpenEnergy Database (oedb)</a>.  This includes raw data, processed data and results .</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:5px">You can <strong>work </strong> with the OpenEnergy Database via the visual interface or a <strong>REST-full HTTP</strong>-interface. Learn more about the <a href="http://oep-data-interface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">OEP API</a> here.
	<li style="margin-bottom:5px">You can <strong>describe, find, and compare energy system models</strong>, frameworks as well as concrete studies and scenarios with the various <a href="http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/factsheets/overview/" target="_blank">Fact Sheets</a>. You can link your code to the model description (<a href="http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/factsheets/models/" target="_blank">Fact Sheets</a>).</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:5px">You can <strong>find and refer literature to models and data</strong> using the <a href="http://oep.iks.cs.ovgu.de/literature/" target="_blank">literature-schema</a> of the oedb. We assume you provide code on the platform of your choice (e.g. GitHub). For all data in the database a minimum of metadata is required in order to improve the transparency.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:5px">You can <strong>harmonize your wording</strong> with other researchers using the <a href="https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Category:Glossary" target="_blank">Glossary</a>. We experienced that transparent data and code doesn’t mean that the results of a study are understandable. Within discussions it is a crucial point to “use the same language”.   In the Glossary the expressions used in the Fact Sheets and in the data tables can be explained and discussed.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:5px"><strong>You are invited to join</strong> <a href="https://github.com/openego/oeplatform/issues" target="_blank">our discussion</a> if you have suggestions or you want to involve yourself into the development. You can participate in the discussion on standardisation of the fact sheets or improvements of the oedb or about including further features. Important: The discussions are still going on.</li>
	<li style="margin-bottom:5px">You can <strong>meet us </strong>at the<a href="https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Events" target="_blank"> openmod meetings</a>!</li>
</ul>
<br/>
With the included tools, we want to promote reproducibility in energy system research. We know that for (most) modelling processes, you need more than just data and code to reproduce results. Especially when complex or different models are involved, a proper code documentation and a description of the steps of the modelling process are needed. We will continuously report and discuss new tools and processes at the openmod meetings. You are invited to contribute!

The function and tools of the OEP are displayed above. Please click on the button to see and learn more about.
<br/><br/>
<u><strong>Framework:</strong></u>
<br/>
The software framework is giving tools and functions for building specific models in order to find results and answers of research questions.
<br/><br/>
<u><strong>Models:</strong></u>
<br/>
Energy models or energy system models are computer models of energy systems. The main purpose of an energy model is to analyze its behavior, the individual components or to analyze how changes in the system will affect results. Such models often employ scenario analysis to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economic or other conditions. See more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_modeling" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
<br/><br/>
<u><strong>Raw data:</strong></u>
</br>
In order to create and calculate scenarios or case studies different raw data is needed to feed the models. Information like weather, spatial information of land-use or infrastructure or time series of energy demand and generation ared used those models. The oedb is structured through predefined schemas in order to organize the heterogeneous data sets contained in the database into defined groups of of similar content.
<br/><br/>
<u><strong>Data processing</strong></u>
<br/>
The data processing of raw data is done by collecting and data manipulation in order to get model specific data sets (input data).
<br/><br/>
<u><strong>Scenario log</strong></u>
<br/>

<br/><br/>
<u><strong>Result data</strong></u>
<br/>
Result data or output data of models.
