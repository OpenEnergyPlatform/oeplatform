    You are at the OpenEnergy DataBase (oedb). Find the Schemata below and the Tags in the field on the right side.

    The basic objectives of the oedb are
    <ul>
        <li> to provide data for energy system modelling </li>
        <li> to provide a space for your result-data of energy system analyses </li>
        <li> to give some insights to basic data and scenario results to non modellers through to graphical representations </li>
    </ul>
The most important functions of the oedb were defined in discussions about transparency, reproducibility and quality of data at <a href="https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/Events"> openmod meetings </a>. <br/>
    Short technical information: The open energy platform is built atop a PostgreSQL database. The software used to build the environment is python 3.4 and django. For explanations about how to install it please read the <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/blob/develop/README.md">README.md</a>. <br/>
PostGre SQL provides the possibility to have a level of categorisation for the datasets. This level is called “Schema”. If you are searching or storing data please use the schemata and the tags.<br/>
Tags are the most important way to make the data detectable. There are categories of tags (colours). You can define new tags but please have a look that you don’t double them. If you have special data for one project or study you can log them with a tag named after the study. Then you can easily make them available.<br/>
