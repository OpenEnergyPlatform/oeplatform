To Do:
Create a query to fetch all the study names from the triple dataset
Display them in the study name user input field as a dropdown menu
user provides input for the study
once the study is chosen then query the sparql endpoint with the SPARQL query "Describe" to
fetch the details about the study.
Once the details are fetched parse through the query output and map the values to relevant keys.
    Example : title - title name
              published year - year
    Inside this function, I have to map the Ontology terms to their respective String values
        Example: OEOXXXXXX - has_author
    Once these mappings are done, then return these values to the form variables.
Use the form variables to display in the output.


Method:
1. Fetch the study names by calling th endpoint directly from JS.Once entered, click button for submit.
2. Map this button to python function:
    1. Calls the endpoint to fetch the study details
    2. Parse the response and maps into respective keys (function)
        3. Parse the Ontology terms to respective string values. (function)
    4. Return the dictionary or values.
5. Display the values in the form
