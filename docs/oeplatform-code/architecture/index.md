# Architecture

This section provides the necessary information to gain a basic technical understanding of the oeplatform software system, in particular the physical scheme of the hardware and software distribution, all modules of the software and the code project structure.

Visit [Infrastructure](./infrastructure.md) to lean about how we describe out hardware and software modules, the distribution and general interfaces that are implemented to drive the oeplatform software.

Read [oeplatform Modules](./modules.md) and [Software Project](./project-structure.md) to learn about how we organize the code and project tools to enable our software development practice. This overview can be used if you want to start getting involved in the oeplatform development on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform).
