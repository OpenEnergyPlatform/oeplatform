# metaBuilder

The metaBuilder is a tool to create, edit and download metadata for the oeplatform.

## Create

## Download

We currently offer multiple download buttons on the OEP. You can either download the metadata while editing the metadata on a table or when you use the standalone version of the metaBuilder. It is also possible to download the metadata when you view the metadata on a table in the "meta information" tab.

When you download the metadata json file the empty fields are kept as "null" values.
