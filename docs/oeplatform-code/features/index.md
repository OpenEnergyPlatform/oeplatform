# OpenEnergyPlatform features

This section provides detailed code documentation to document the implementation
of all features of the oeplatform. In the
[Architecture/Modules](../architecture/modules.md) section, we have already
provided a brief overview of all the software modules (Django apps) that we
maintain in the oeplatform.
