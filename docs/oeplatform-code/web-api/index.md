# Web APIÂ´s

This section describes the web APIs provided by the oeplatform. In the context of the oeplatform, the web APIs include http request interfaces that require an expected request body with a JSON data structure to formulate the specific request. As a result, a JSON response is sent back.

Currently, a REST API is used that provides basic data management functions for interacting with the OEDB, with a focus on interacting with the data uploaded by users. The other WEB API provides functions for interacting with the scenario bundles. With this API, users can perform complex semantic queries.
