# oeplatform django apps

In this section we document the oeplatform applications. As we not yet migrated the architecture to a more commonly used one we maintain all apps in the root django project directory. This impacts how we apply settings as configuration to the whole system. Each App implements a specific group of features to provide solutions to certain user needs. We implement the apps to provide very specific tool to all users and encourage them to upload and document their data. This approach reflects our vision to continually publish our research work results as publicly usable functionality. This requirement we set ourself often brings a lot of extra effort as usability must also be prioritized. This correctly suggests that each app also maintains a user interface and possibly also some app specific data is stored in the django database.
