# Base - Navigation Bar


The **Navigation Bar** on top of the page is visible on all pages. On
wide screens all elements are shown next to each other. On small screens
the bar can be accessed on the \"hamburger icon\".

The navigation bar is done in `base/templates/base`:

-   `base.html`
-   `base-wide.html`

It is either a link or a submenu with individual links.
