Developer documentation of the Open Energy Platform (OEP)
=========================================================

The Open Energy Platform is a website that has three main targets:

> 1.  Provide a language-independent interface that is a thin layer on
>     top of the Open Energy Database (oedb)
> 2.  Implement an intuitive and easy-to use web interface on top of the
>     database
> 3.  Improve the visibility, communication and transparency of results
>     from energy system modelling

Mission statement
-----------------

The transition to renewable energy sources is one of the huge goals of
the last few decades. Whilst conventional energy generation provides a
constant, generally available source of electricity, heat and so on, our
environment pays a toll. Contrary, renewable energy generation is less
environmentally demanding but more financially expensive or just locally
or inconsistently available. Guaranteeing a steady and reliable, yet
sustainable supply of energy requires still a lot of thorough research.

Expansion of the energy grid might imply measures that must be
communicable in a transparent way. Hence, results from research of
energy system studies should be publicly available and reproducible.
This raises the need for publicly available data sources.
