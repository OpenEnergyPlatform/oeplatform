# Planning & Communication

The OpenEnergyFamily got diverse family members each of them includes many task to maintain and extend them. A big part of it is Software like smaller tools but especially the OEP-Website, then there is a metadata specification, we maintain an extensive academy to provide information about how to use tools and navigate the family and more. Next to this we are maintaining the infrastructure of the OpenEnergyPlatform, we must install new updates, keep the software & hardware up to function and up to date.

Our core team can offer guidance on specific questions and they will keep and overview on latest developments, technical & other decisions and have access to the infrastructure. Additionally we organize developer meetings that are open to the public. In some cases we have a strict agenda most of the time there will be room to address questions and help with getting started with the OpenEnergyPlatform.
