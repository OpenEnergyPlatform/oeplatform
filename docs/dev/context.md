# Project context

The OpenEnergyFamily and OpenEnergyPlatform are developed since 2016. We want to
outline the context and some constrains in this section to clear some
assumptions which have been made frequently by users.

## What is our goal

Since the beginning of development many features and software tools have been
delivered, still there is many room for improvement. Since we did mostly
research work we developed a wide variety of tools which all solve specific
research questions. In the process there is mostly not much room for topics like
usability, software and infrastructure maintenance, and even documentation. We
where focused on writing papers, fixing requirements and getting research
project focused work done. The outcome is that we mainly delivered tools for
experts and people we can provide hands on demonstrations. By connecting the
OpenEnergyFamily with the NFDI4Energy consortium we started to readjust our role
more into the direction of a service provider whit more focus on enhancing what
we have, reducing complexity and creating good and complete documentation.

## Personas & Use Cases

To get a better understanding about out user base with the goal of enhancing the
adaption rate of our services we created personas and documented use cases.
Below you can find the links, keep in mind these are "living" documents which
will have to be updated from time to time.
