# Community

We are committed to build a group of suspects that want to create software applications around open science supporting open data and linked data to solve issues raised by the energy system modelling and its traceability of any aspect of the modelling process, data analysis and presentation. Comparisons across an large range of scenarios and the related input/output datasets become feasible. In our use case Scenarios are related to a scenario bundle which links all relevant publications and provide additional information.

Still this is only our current mission, we are open for other use cases to extend the vision for the OpenEnergyFamily. 

## Collaboration

You can collaborate in many ways for example by joining discussions even by sharing your personal experience or if you simply know better help out by sharing your expertise. Changes that are approved by the community find its way into our applications. They will be rolled out regularly into practice and its effect can be experienced by others. You can always propose pull request by forking our repositories, if you want to raise your contribution efforts and add value regularly you can always become part of the GitHub organization and be assigned a developer role.

In our repositories we provide a CONTRIBUTION.md with specific instructions on how to contribute to the specific code / content base. As general guideline we focus most on transparency during our development activity. This includes additional efforts for documentation of every major step of the development and in detail all pieces of content that are added to a repository. Using Git helps with the fine grained documentation by requiring commits to add the new pieces. By leveraging GitHub issues and pull requests we require contributors to first describe and discuss what they want to change or add within issues and also if they provide an implementation their work becomes visible to others in pull requests. Commits are automatically linked to pull requests and can be linked to specific issues they aim to solve.
