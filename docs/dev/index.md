# Getting started with development

This section gets you started with contribution to the development of the oeplatform software which is part of the OpenEnergyFamily. The development takes place on GitHub and most communication is handled in GitHub Issues, Pull Requests and discussions. Additionally developer meetings are used to talk about latest developments. E-Mails and Matrix/Element chat can be added to the pool once one commits to regular contributions.

## Guidelines for contribution

See our [developer guidelines](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) and get in touch with our [developer team](https://openenergyplatform.github.io/organisation/family_community/contact/).

## The workflow we follow

We created a rather detailed development process which outlines the general tasks and describes roles and their responsibilities. This rather formal process is not meant to provide strict borders as many contributors are no professional software developers but it can scale once a team wants to commit. The detailed process also outlines tasks which are partly automated by now.
