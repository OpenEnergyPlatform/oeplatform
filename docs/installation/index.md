# Installation

The [Installation Guide](./install/installation.md) section provides detailed information required to install the oeplatform software and its infrastructure composed of the website, various databases, a lookup service and the ontop-vkg service (see [Infrastructure](../oeplatform-code/architecture/infrastructure.md)). You will find two main options to install everything:

    1. A docker based deployment setup for development (and soon for productions)
    2. A "manual" step by step installation guide for the oeplatform-website and its main features. The guide is mainly for development and documents the details of the installation. Production deployments without containerization solutions like docker tend to be very specific and depend on your infrastructure.

You will also find information on which further setup steps should be carried out in order to start developing the oeplatform software. The content of the documents are intended to get new developers started and help users setting up their own instance of the oeplatform software independent form the contents available on openenergyplatform.org.
