# Installation

The [Installation](./install/installation.md) section provides detailed information required to install the oeplatform software. In addition to the website, this includes various databases (see [Infrastructure](../oeplatform-code/architecture/infrastructure.md)) and other services. You will also find information on which further setup steps should be carried out in order to start developing the oeplatform software. In that sense this section is structured to get new developers started or to help users setting up their own instance of the oeplatform software independent form the contents available on openenergyplatform.org.
