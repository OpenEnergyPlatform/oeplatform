## What the Rest-API offers

When working with data, it is very helpful to be able to implement programmatic solutions for managing data resources. The Rest API provides such functionality by opening the underlying database of the OEP website via HTTP. Users can access data tables under specific IRI's and retrieve various information artefacts. Following the REST specification, the common JSON format is used to transfer the data. External applications can easily process such JSON data and also upload new data to the database. This document provides information on the so called API Endpoint specification. This Information is relevant to use the CRUD functionality of the REST-API.

## TBD

OpenAPI-based documentation for all API endpoints will be created here.
