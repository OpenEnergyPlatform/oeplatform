# Installation & Code Documentation

The [Installation](./install/installation.md) section provides detailed information required to install the oeplatform software. In addition to the website, this includes various databases (see [Infrastructure](./oeplatform-code/architecture/infrastructure.md)). You will also find information on which further setup steps should be carried out in order to start developing the oeplatform software.

The [Documentation](./oeplatform-code/) section provides documentation about the code and is currently incomplete. We aim to provide a full documentation about our soft- and hardware Infrastructure. The code is documented for each feature that is actively implemented. While some features are missing in the documentation as it was not available or lost after the implementation we will constantly review the code an document the missing parts.

!!! Note
We structure the document by providing information about the WEB-APIÂ´s and the code grouped by the Features it implements.
