# Changes to the oeplatform code

## Changes

- Speed up the row upload API: index the unapplied rows of the edit-journal meta
  tables (`_<table>_insert/_edit/_delete`, back-filled by an oedb migration),
  mark applied rows with one set-based update instead of a per-row OR chain,
  scan only the meta table relevant to the operation, and apply changes exactly
  once per request instead of twice. Also fixes a bug where the first change of
  each type was dropped when a meta table held mixed pending change types.
  [(#2362)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/issues/2362)
- Refactor user groups into organizations; add fields to the organization model;
  refactor HTMX for organization management pages
  [(#2261)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/2261)

## Features

## Bugs

- Deleting a peer review now checks the caller: only its reviewer or a platform
  admin may delete it
  [(#2544)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/2544)
- Restrict profile pages to their owner and check organization permissions
  before saving
