# Changes to the oeplatform code

## Changes

- Open peer review: Fields that are none(=empty) are no longer part of the review. These fields are visible, but the review actions cannot be applied there. [(#1700)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1700)

- In the scenario bundles, the linked input and output tables often use an outdated format, which leads to inconsistent links. We mitigate the effects of this by handling the different URL variants until a data migration has taken place. [(#1740)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1740)

- Scenario Bundles: Linked model & framework factsheets are now listed by acronym and rendered as clickable pills that guide to the factsheetÂ´s detail page. Additionally an useful tooltip is shown when hovering a option form the dropdown while selecting a framework or model factsheet [(#1740)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1740)
