# Changes to the oeplatform code

## Changes

- Open-Peer-Review [(#1800)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1800)
- Removed state suggestions for accepted fields.
- Updated recursive_update function to handle deletion and overwriting of suggested/rejected values.
- Removed value requirements for "deny" buttons in certain actions.

- Change sparql endpoint for OEKG to use the http post method to match the expected usage. The OEKG API is also extended to return data in common rdf/graph formats like tutle or json ld [(#1928)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1928).

- Remove the old metadata widget and laverage from v0 generation for a new simple prototype that enhances the overview and usage quality when reading oemetadata. [(#1954)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1954)

Update the oemetadata sectionin 'dataedit/static/metaEdit/' to enable metadata editing for the new oemetadata v2. Additionally, introduce more extensive category tabs to enhance the metaBuilder UI [(#1914)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1914).

- All metadata in the oeplatform will now use oemetadata v2 specifications. Current metadata will be converted and all new metadata submitting in previous versions will also be converted to the new specification. [(#1954)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1954)

- Deactivate the open peer review feature. It is under construction for the oemetadata v2.0 update [(#1959)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1959)

## Features

- Open-Peer-Review [(#1800)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1800)
- Added a new button Save Comments for adding comments to rejected fields.
- Display functionality for add_comment fields was implemented for rejected items.
- Enabled active ok button functionality without page reload for unreviewed fields.

- Reworked metadata widget: Gaining more controlled on what is and what is not visible while displaying most of the metadata string. Compared to the previous version especially the mew nested and sometimes very long full print of the json document became uneasy to read still the advantage was a quick lookup on certain entries - we will provide a text search in a lter iteration [(#1954)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1954)

- Full support for oemetadata v2.0 including a automated version conversion for oemetadata documents uploaded via the metadata api. This will apply for all metadata documents which are uploaded and do not yet hold a version identifier for v2 [(#1954)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1954)

## Bugs

- Open-Peer-Review [(#1800)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1800):
- Fixed bug with displaying the same field twice.
- Addressed an issue with missing fields for "suggest/deny" and status in specific contexts.
- Disabled unnecessary "ok/deny" buttons for reviewer-rejected fields.
- Corrected metadata updates by removing functionality for rejected fields in PeerReview & Table tables.
- Resolved issue where the status label showed "Missing" instead of "Pending" on submission.
- Fixed display issues with empty fields when there were two statuses.

- Fix outdated service url to send requests to the LEOP from the oemetaBuilder and oeo-extended features[(#1938)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1938).

## Documentation updates

- Updated documentation to simplify usage of vendor software swagger ui and update the documentation on scenario bundles. Add documentation on how to use the updated OEKG web API [(#1928)](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/oeplatform/pull/1928).
