Fact Sheet objectives: The Fact Sheets are made to...
<ul>
    <li>Find models/frameworks for your needs or just get an overview about the existing ones</li>
    <li>Compare a selection of models for different purposes - e.g. to develop a strategy to link them</li>
    <li>Store your model/framework information to provide transparency</li>
</ul>

<b>Use case example model Fact Sheet:</b> For a European pathway simulation (EPS) we
want to choose the models that best meet our requirements. All partners include
their models in the Model Fact Sheets and tag them with “EPS”. To compare the
models we filter all “EPS” models and choose different characteristics that we
want to compare. OEP will give us tables (views) that facilitate the comparison.
