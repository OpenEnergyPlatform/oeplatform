  <h2>Factsheets Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Open Energy Platform hosts a series of factsheets â€“ currently we offer
    <a href="{% url 'modelview:modellist' 'model' %}">Model Factsheets</a>,
    <a href="{% url 'modelview:modellist' 'framework' %}"
      >Framework Factsheets</a
    >
    and <a href="">Scenario Factsheets</a> that help to learn more about the
    context of the data you can find in the database. The Factsheets are a
    standardized collection and presentation of information about modelling
    software used in climate and energy system modelling. The use of interactive
    fields and pre-defined responses is designed to make it easy to insert data
    and filter for existing entries. For example, you may want to know more
    about the background of some of the data you found than the metadata
    attached directly to it can provide. Then factsheets are a helpful place to
    visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, our current Scenario Factsheets provide some dedicated
    information about specific scenarios for which projection data is available
    on the OEP. Please note, however, that their format was developed some time
    ago and they will undergo substantial updates. In the future, these scenario
    factsheets will also be succeeded by
    <a href="">Study Factsheets (alpha)</a> that will hold more functionality.
    These improved factsheets will be based on RDF and the
    <a href="{{ EXTERNAL_URLS.github_openenergyplatform_oekg }}"
      >Open Energy Knowledge Graph (OEKG)</a
    >
    which is currently under heavy development. Please note that this is just a
    preview and not a fully functional feature yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    These study factsheets will inform about scenario contexts and enable you to
    explore scenario bundles. Scenario bundles tie together various information
    about a scenario available on the OEP. This includes information on the
    scenario projection data available, the frameworks and models applied, and
    the study context. Study factsheets will make these relations visible and
    usable. And not only that: the study factsheets will be based on the
    concepts available in the Open Energy Ontology (OEO).

    Anyone is invited to contribute to development as this is a community-driven
    process. Most of the development takes place on GitHub. We have some
    <a

      >helpful guidelines</a
    >
    on the workflow providing detailed information.
